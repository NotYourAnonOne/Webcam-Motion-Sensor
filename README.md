# Webcam Motion Detector

## Overview
The Webcam Motion Detector is a C++ application that utilizes the OpenCV library to detect motion using your computer's webcam or an IP camera. The application captures video frames and analyzes changes between consecutive frames to identify motion in the scene. It's a simple yet effective way to monitor your surroundings for any movement.

## Features
- Real-time motion detection using the camera feed.
- Visual representation of detected motion areas in the form of a binary image.
- Compatible with both local webcams and IP cameras.
- Easily adjustable motion sensitivity using a threshold parameter.

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have OpenCV installed in your C++ development environment.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Adjust the camera source URL in the code to match your camera's IP address (for IP cameras).
4. Compile and run the application.
5. The application will display a window showing the areas with detected motion.

## Enhancements
This project is just the beginning. You can enhance it by:
- Implementing object tracking to follow moving objects.
- Adding the ability to send alerts or notifications when motion is detected.
- Logging motion events to a file or database for future analysis.
- Integrating machine learning models for more accurate motion detection.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, and submit a pull request. Whether you're adding features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation, your efforts will be appreciated.
